The wc command allows us to count words, lines and characters in our files. By just writing 'wc' it lists all three for us
but we can specify exactly what we want counting in the command. -l for lines, -w for words and -m for characters. 
wc is useful when piping from previous outputs. So if we want to count how many README files are in the home directory, we could write
find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep README | wc -l.
